Ocelot and AOcelot and APIM are both API gateways.

Ocelot is an Open Source project and you need to host it yourself in your infrastructure.
APIM is a Microsoft Azure service offering. It does everything you can find in Ocelot plus certain other things more. You can check docs to figure this out.
APIM being a service offered by Azure (i.e. Microsoft) you can get support from MS if you are having production issues. With APIM you also have a concept of Serverless.

So everything boils down to: do you enjoy creating + maintaining your gateway infrastructure and want more control - then it's Ocelot. Else it's APIM.
